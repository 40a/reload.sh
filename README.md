# `reload.sh`

Silly but interesting way to reinstall your system without using a cd-rom, flash memory and anything you could think about this process.

## How it works?

  > At this moment supports only debian-like distributions.

```bash
./bin/reload.sh --base /tmp/base --build /tmp/system.tgz
```
